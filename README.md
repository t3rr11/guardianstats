The profile page contains a huge amount of information on the selected player, you can see how many exotics they have obtained to gain a battle advantage or too see what you may be up against as well as being able to view their KD ratio to gauge their level of skill. As well as being able to see their seals obtained. These are awesome in-game feats that show the level of detication these players have put into the game.
